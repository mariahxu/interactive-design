  	<h3>YOU KNOW IT'S <mark>5:03 PM</mark> IF:</h3>
  		<p>Mariah enters the dining hall once more, this time perched on the back of her noble steed, Boyfriend, who is a full head taller than her. They ready themselves for battle (with food).</p><br>
  	<h3>YOU KNOW IT'S <mark>6:30 PM</mark> IF:</h3>
  		<p>Mariah has sat eating dinner with three completely different sets of people because they keep finishing their food and leaving, only to be replaced with another friend or acquaintence.</p><br>
  	<h3>YOU KNOW IT'S <mark>8:28 PM</mark> IF:</h3>

  	<h3>YOU KNOW IT'S <mark>11:59 PM</mark> IF:</h3>
  		<p>Mariah realizes that she's a procrastinating excuse of a student, and that she is no longer qualified to write 'I believe I would be a strong addition to <input type="text" value="name of design firm">because I am hard-working and responsible' in her cover letter without being a liar. She puts on her big girl pants and vows never to be so irresponsible again.</p><br>
<hr>
  	<h3> LITTLE DOES SHE KNOW...</h3>
  		<p>...she has become the Human Timepiece, doomed to repeat her mistakes at every stroke of midnight! Oh, who in the name of productivity will save her against the mighty grip of the <em>Procrastatron<sup>1</sup></em>? <strong>Dun dun dun!</strong><br><br>
